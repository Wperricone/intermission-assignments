1. React Review (required)
Create a GitHub gist to answer these questions in as much detail as possible. Imagine someone is asking these questions in an interview (these are popular interview questions).

### What is a "data model", and how does it relate to the DOM in a front-end application?
- The Data Model is what holds onto all of our data and how different kinds of data interact. The DOM is the visual representation of our Data Model, in otherwords how hour data shows up on the page.

### What is a "framework?" And how does it differ from a "library?"
- A framework is like built-in scaffolding for our website. It has more rules than a library, but helps keep the code in sync with the UI. A library is more like the paint of our website. Scaffolding has to be done a certain way by a professional, whereas painting can be done by me and can be flexible. So the library has fewer rules and is a collection of codes written by me, and I can call it whenever I want (the reusable code is like paint cans, and I can open one and paint it wherever I want) 

### Why should we consider using a framework over vanilla JS like you have been doing in mods 1 and 2?
- because it is not possible to write complex, efficient and easy to maintain UIs with vanilla JS. The framework provides the ability to implement UIs that are guaranteed to be in sync with the internal state of the app, without being overly complex and inefficient. 

### What is a "component" in React? Why is it useful to have components?
- components are like individual parts of code like a function, that can be dynamic and take in properties. They are designed to be reused so we can make our code more concise and efficient. 

### What is JSX?
- JSX is like a combination of JS and HTML. We use JSX to write HTML in react, so we don't have to separate all JS and HTML like we do with vanilla JS.

### What are React "props?"
- Props in React is properties. Using props helps make components dynamic and reusable. 

### What is React "state?"
-

What does "data down, actions up" mean in React?
